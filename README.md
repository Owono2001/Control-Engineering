# Control-Engineering
The "Washing Machine Control System" assignment involves designing a vibration control system using MATLAB and Simulink.

The Control Engineering assignment titled "Washing Machine Control System" focuses on designing and simulating a system to control and reduce vibrations in a washing machine using MATLAB and Simulink. The objective is to enhance the washing machine's performance by minimizing vibrations, which lead to noise and mechanical issues, especially due to unbalanced loads. The project applies a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller to regulate the system's behavior, ensuring stability and reducing overshoot and settling time. The team worked collaboratively to analyze the washing machine as a dynamic system, develop transfer functions, and simulate the results using different control methods.

The simulation demonstrates the benefits of using a PID controller, showing reduced vibrations, noise, and improved settling time. Each team member contributed by handling various parts of the design, coding, and tuning the control system. The assignment provides a comprehensive analysis of how different controller settings impact the washing machine's response to unbalanced loads and disturbances, leading to a more stable and efficient machine.
